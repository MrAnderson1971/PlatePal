# Group Moai🗿 - PlatePal

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

PlatePal is an app that helps users create and find recipes based on ingredients they have on hand. PlatePal is for all the university students, aspiring home chefs, “girl dinner” girlies, and just about anyone out there who wants to cook but only has 5 ingredients in their pantry at a time. Based on the ingredients that users input, PlatePal will use AI to generate recipes that can be made using those ingredients. Our app will store data on users and recipes so that users can log in to their accounts and favourite recipes to revisit anytime. Depending on development constraints, we plan to implement either a feature for AI-generated images of dishes or a feature for users to upload their own recipe photos.


## Project Task Requirements

3-5 Minimal Requirements (will definitely complete)
- User login feature with username and password
- Inputting the ingredients via search and select
- Button to generate recipe
- Viewing the actual recipe instructions

3-7 Standard Requirements (will most likely complete)
- Have the AI generate the recipe based on the inputted ingredients
- Favouriting recipes and viewing the saved recipes
- Modifying saved recipes such as editing the ingredient list or changing an instruction
- Sorting and filtering functionality for generated recipes 
- Upvoting/downvoting a recipe? 
- Regular image upload for recipe (if AI doesn’t work out)

2-3 Stretch Requirements (plan to complete at least 1!)
- (AI-generated) images of what the dish looks like
- Create a “Pinterest”-like dashboard for sharing among users


## Task Breakdown
User login feature with username and password
- Frontend form for the users to fill in login/registration info
- Backend API to create new user
- Implement JWT for end-to-end user login/registration

Viewing the actual recipe instructions
- Create recipe schema in backend
- Backend API to fetch the generated recipe
- Having a UI page to display the recipe and load the recipe content
